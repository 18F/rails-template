          Any vulnerabilities in #{app_name} would have to be introduced at time of deployment because #{app_name}
          is a set of cloud.gov managed applications with SSH disabled in Production. #{app_name} monitors for
          vulnerabilities by ensuring that scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications occur
          daily and when new code is deployed.

          OWASP ZAP scans are built into the #{app_name} CI/CD pipeline and runs a series of web vulnerability scans before
          a successful deploy can be made to cloud.gov. Any issues or alerts caused by the scan are documented by #{app_name}
          Operations and cause the deployment to fail. Issues are tracked in GitHub. The issue posted will provide information
          on which endpoints are vulnerable and the level of vulnerability, ranging from **False Positive** to **High**.
          The issue also provides a detailed report formatted in html, json, and markdown.

          #{app_name} Administrators are responsible for reporting any new vulnerabilities reported by the OWASP ZAP scan to the #{app_name} ISSO.

          1. Alerts from each ZAP vulnerability scan are automatically reported in GitHub as an issue on the #{app_name} repository.
          This issue will enumerate each finding and detail the type and severity of the vulnerability. #{app_name} Developers and
          #{app_name} Administrators receive automated alerts via GitHub of the issues to remediate. Scan results are sent to the
          #{app_name} System Owner by #{app_name} Administrators. The vulnerabilities are analyzed and prioritized within GitHub
          based on input from the #{app_name} System Owner and ISSO.
          1. The ZAP report contains vulnerabilities grouped by type and by risk level. The report also provides a detailed report
          formatted in html, json, and markdown. The reported issues also include the CVE item associated with the vulnerability.
          1. Vulnerabilities are classified by ZAP under a level range from **False Positive** to **High**. The impact level is
          used to drive the priority of the effort to remediate.

          The CI/CD pipeline utilizes multiple tools to perform static code analysis for security and privacy:

          * **Brakeman** is a static code scanner designed to find security issues in Ruby on Rails code. It can flag potential SQL injection,
          Command Injection, open redirects, and other common vulnerabilities.
          * **bundle-audit** checks Ruby dependencies against a database of known CVE numbers.
          * **yarn audit** checks Javascript dependencies against a database of known CVE numbers.
          * **OWASP ZAP** is a dynamic security scanner that can simulate actual attacks on a running server.

          An additional RAILS_ENV has been created called ci. It inherits from production to ensure that the system being tested is as close as possible to production while allowing for overrides such as bypassing authentication in a secure way.

          #{app_name} utilizes public open source Ruby and NodeJS components.

          #{app_name} utilizes dependency scanning tools Bundle Audit and Yarn Audit to find vulnerable or insecure dependencies.

          If a vulnerable or insecure dependency is found it will be upgraded or replaced. Additionally the #{app_name} team code
          review processes include a review of the health (up to date, supported, many individuals involved) of direct open source dependencies.

          As an additional layer of protection, all PII data is encrypted using [Active Record Encryption â€” Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html).
          This encryption is implemented in a using non-deterministic AES-256-GCM through Ruby's openssl library with a 256-bit key and a random initialization vector {rails crypto module}.

          The Data Encryption Key is stored in the credentials.yml file in an encrypted format by Ruby's openssl library using the AES-128-GCM cipher,
          and is built into the application package.

          The credentials.yml decryption key is stored in #{ci} and injected into the running application as an environmental variable. The application then uses this key
          to decrypt the credentials.yml file and obtain the Data Encryption Key.

          Flaw and vulnerability checks are built into the #{app_name} CI/CD pipeline and automated to ensure compliance.
          Dynamic vulnerability scans are performed against #{app_name} before a successful deployment and reports issues after every scan.
          Compliance is documented in sections SA-11 and RA-5. The #{app_name} DevOps team uses GitHub as the Product Backlog to
          track and prioritize issues related to system flaws.

          The responsibility of remediating flaws and vulnerabilities (once a remediation is available) falls on the #{app_name} Developer,

          Any flaws or vulnerabilities resolved in #{app_name} result in a GitHub issue for triage via the #{app_name} CM Configuration Control
          process described in CM-2(2). After resolving a vulnerability or flaw in #{app_name}, unit tests and integration tests are updated to
          prevent further inclusion of similar flaws.

          * All GitHub tickets have accompanying Acceptance Criteria that are used to create unit tests.
          * Unit tests are run on the Development environment when new code is pushed.
          * Integration tests are run on the Test environment when the remediation is deployed via the CI/CD process to ensure that the production
          environment does not suffer from any side effects of the vulnerability remediation.
          * Integration tests are run on the Prod environment when the remediation is deployed via the CI/CD process to validate the remediation and application functionality.
          * All findings that are not remediated immediately are tracked in the #{app_name} Plan of Action and Milestones (POAM) by #{app_name} Operations and the #{app_name} ISSO.
